This case is very similar to the vx_tutorial1, the only difference is that more than one node(five node) are added in the graph.
The five node are Gaussian3x3 -> Sobel3x3 -> Magniude -> ConvertDepth -> Threshold .
The input image will be processed in accordance with this algorithm sequence.
NO arguments are required to run this program.
