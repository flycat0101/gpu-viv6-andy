vx_tutorial1 and vx_tutorial2 only using build-in nodes in OpenVX library, but in vx_tutorial3 shows how to use usr-define node in application based on OpenVX framework.
This tutorial using two image as inputs, by default named left_gray.bmp and right_gray.bmp. And defined the kernel named vxcAbsDiff which calc the absolute different value between two input images and write output image.
In this kernel, shows how to use EVIS instructions to accelerate , and also shows how to using read and write image instructions.
The relevant validate functions are also introduced, shows how to verify the kernel parameters.
NO arguments are required to run this program.
