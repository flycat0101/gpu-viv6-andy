This tutorial include two projects: kernel library project in the folder of kernel and application project which in app folder. Appliation project using kernel library.
The tutorial4 kernel implements the Bayer Demosaic Filtering, please refer to the relevant algorithm documents at the path of \vx_tutorial4\app\Doc.
In this kernel, we are not only using EVIS instructions, but also using DP tools to define the specific instructions, we can get DP uniforms in the folder of unifom.
In application project,
	The parameter set of vx_tutorial4 is as the following:
	-f  data_file_list.txt    Input data list. Please put your test data names here (data at per row, ).
	-w  1920           	Width of input data
	-h  1080            Height of input data
	-c  10              GPU clock on FPGA
