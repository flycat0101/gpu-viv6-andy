Vivante HWComposer Module

Vivante Corporation

Overview

    HWComposer is used by surfaceflinger to enhance composition from android
    honeycomb and later. Vivante HWComposer can use 2D blit, multi-source blit
    for that purpose.

    Vivante HWComposer can support plane alpha (global alpha) and dim layer. To
    enable plane alpha and dim, please patch hwcomposer.h/surfaceflinger.

    Please reference 'README' file in hwcomposer_android_patch patckage for more
    information.


Display Integration

    1. [important] Please implement display confiugration call back functions in
       'gc_hwc_display.cpp', especially for function 'hwcInitDisplays'.

    2. [important] implement eglGetRenderBufferVIV, eglPostBufferVIV for
       non-Vivante EGL. Please see 'gc_hwc_display.h' for detail.


OVERLAY Integration

    1. Some overlay devices can only display areas which are cleared as
       transparet in framebuffer. If your device is like that, please make sure
       'CLEAR_FB_FOR_OVERLAY' is set to '1' in 'gc_hwc.h'.

    2. Please add your own code in 'hwcOverlay' function (gc_hwc_overlay.cpp) to
       do actual overlay functionalities.


VSYNC Integration

    Hardware vsync is supported in hwcomposer after JellyBean. Each hardware
    vsync varies. It is VENDOR's responsibility to implement hardware vsync in
    hwc.

    Currently a reference vsync handler is already implemented. The 'fake' vsync
    does not handle hardware vsyncs, but only sleep for a specific time for
    vsync simulation.

    Please add your hardware vsync handler in 'gc_hwc_vsync.cpp'.
      1. Initialize vysnc in 'hwcVsyncSetup'.
      2. Handle vsync events in 'vsyncThread'.


Prepare and Build

    1. Patch android system to support dim/plane alpha [OPTIONAL].
    2. Please set proper optimization switch in 'gc_hwc.h' if needed.

    Build HWComposer like a normal android project (type 'mm' to build).


Debug features

    Use following command to dump layer information:
        setprop hwc.debug.dump_compose 2

    Use following command to dump 2D composition operation:
        setprop hwc.debug.dump_compose 4

    Use following command to dump FPS:
        setprop hwc.debug.dump_compose 8

    Use following command to dump all 3 above:
        setprop hwc.debug.dump_compose 1

    Use following command to dump layer input and framebuffer out to bitmaps:
        setprop hwc.debug.dump_bitmap 1

    Use following command to force disable 2D output compression:
        setprop hwc.debug.disable_compression 1


Known Issues

    1. 2D PE 1.x is not supported.
    2. COVERAGE alpha blending is not exactly correct in alpha channel.
