Note (11/01/2017):

The following directories:

    DRI/...
    DRI_1.10.4/...
    drm/...

are ONLY used for the legacy DRI framework support. They are NOT compatible with the
latest DRI3 framework. Thus they are not used for DRI3 framework support anymore.

The following directory:

    EXA/...

includes X11 EXA driver based on Vivante 2D GPU. It supports both DRI and DRI3 frameworks.

Vivante 6.2.4 and later driver releases fully support the DRI3 framework. The DRI3 kernel driver
support is included in the Vivante kernel driver galcore.ko. The Vivante DRI3 user-mode
library libdrm.so source code is included in the directory

    libdrm-2.4.66/...

To build X11 drivers for the DRI3 framework, set the following environment variables as:

    export BUILD_OPTION_X11_DRI3=1
    export BUILD_OPTION_EGL_API_DRI=0

To build X11 drivers for the legacy DRI framework, set the following environment variables as:

    export BUILD_OPTION_X11_DRI3=0
    export BUILD_OPTION_EGL_API_DRI=1
